# Learning Kotlin

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ This is where I'm keeping my Kotlin practice and study notes. I'm learning Kotlin to explore a new language and maybe build cool things in the future. This repo is just a place to track my progress and store what I'm learning.
I'm just getting started with the language, so you'll find simple examples, exercises, and random code as I learn how Kotlin works.

## What you'll find here

- Basic syntax  
- Variables, functions, and conditionals  
- Loops and collections  
- Object-oriented stuff (classes, objects, etc.)  
- Little experiments and random tests  

## No pressure, just learning. ðŸš€
